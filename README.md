# Cherryade

Cherryade is a lightweight PHP templating engine developed by Cherryade.co.

## Setup & Installation

Clone the Cherryade repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/cherryade/cherryade.git.
```
Place the files on your server, and then edit cherryade/cherryade.config.php to your liking.

The default template has already been created within ./index.php, this calls the HTML from ./templates/template.html and replaces [sitename] and [sitepath] with 'Cherryade' and 'http://www.cherryade.co'.

## Continuous Development

Cherryade is an open source project which anyone can download and contribute towards. We're developing addons which are available to download from our [website](http://www.cherryade.co) and in other [repositories](http://www.github.com/cherryade/) and we will continue to develop the main cherryade repo.
